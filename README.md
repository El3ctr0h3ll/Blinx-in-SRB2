## To-do / info list

## -- moveset --

make the spin button for the sweeper

add a slide/groundpound so blinx can do the routes that require to roll and so blinx complete Deep Sea Zone Act 2 (groundpound)
### -- buttons set --
- spin - Sweeper 
- custom button 1 - Time Controls menu
[use jump in the Time Controls menu and movement keys for selecting controls]
- custom button 2 - melee
- custom button 3 - slide/groundpound

## -- Crystals --

i think the idea is to replace rings with the Crystals, but you can only get RETRY crystal from enameys 

MAYBE make it so you can change form the Blinx 1 Combinations stye Blinx 2 stye *but that for an update i say*

-- Sprites --
the Crystals should be the same or simiar size the the ring sprite

-- Graphics --
for the Time Controls that the player has none of make them grey insted of transparnt do to how srb2 works transparnty is more difficult
