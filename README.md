# Blinx-in-SRB2

To-do / info list

-- moveset --

maybe make the spin button for the sweeper

maybe add a slide so blinx can do the routes that require to roll

-- Crystals --

i think the idea is to replace ring with the Crystals, but you can only get RETRY crystal from enameys 

MAYBE make it so you can change form the Blinx 1 Combinations stye Blinx 2 stye but that for an update i say

-- Sprites --
the Crystals should be the same or simiar size the the ring sprite

-- Graphics --
for the nonselected Time Controls grey insted of transparnt do to how srb2 works transparnty is more difficult
